# Activity Tracker with LogDNA events
{: #at-events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started).

## Supported locations
{: #at-supported-locations}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full}} support is currently available for the Dallas location. 

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by VPC resources are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch#launch_step2).
